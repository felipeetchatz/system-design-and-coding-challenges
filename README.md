# System Design & Coding Challenges

A repository dedicated to solving system design challenges, inspired by the principles and concepts from **"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"** by Martin Kleppmann.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains solutions and implementations for various system design challenges, focusing on building scalable, reliable, and maintainable distributed systems. Each challenge explores different aspects of data-intensive applications, including:

- **Reliability, Scalability, and Maintainability**
- **Data Models and Query Languages**
- **Storage and Retrieval**
- **Encoding and Evolution**
- **Replication**
- **Partitioning**
- **Transactions**
- **Consistency and Consensus**
- **Batch Processing**
- **Stream Processing**

## 📚 Learning Resources

- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) by Martin Kleppmann
- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each challenge is organized in its own directory with:
- Problem statement and requirements
- Design document
- Implementation (if applicable)
- Trade-offs and considerations

## 📋 Challenges

### Challenge 1: URL Shortener (TinyURL/bit.ly)
📁 `challenges/01-url-shortener/`

### Challenge 2: Notification Service
📁 `challenges/02-notification-service/`

## 🧪 Implementation Approach

For each challenge, we follow this process:

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements (scale, performance, availability)
   - Constraints and assumptions

2. **System Design**
   - High-level architecture
   - API design
   - Database schema
   - Component interactions

3. **Deep Dive**
   - Scalability considerations
   - Reliability and fault tolerance
   - Performance optimization
   - Security considerations

4. **Implementation** (Optional)
   - Prototype or full implementation
   - Testing
   - Monitoring and observability
